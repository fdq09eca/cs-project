The directors’ benefits comprise meeting allowance as and when incurred, after the NEDs have discharged their services to the Company.For the proposed Ordinary Resolution No. 3, the total amount payable is estimated for a period of 13 months from the 30th AGM until the next AGM, based on the current Board remuneration structure and taking into account various factors including the number of scheduled Board meetings and Board committees meetings as well as the number of NEDs to be attended in these meetings.(b) For the proposed Ordinary Resolution No. 9, the tenure of Mr YU Hon To, David as an INED shall commence when the Company was dual-listed on Bursa Securities on 30 April 2008.

During the first half of 2020, demand letters have been sent to the borrowers by the Group™s legal representative, but the Group received neither reply nor repayment from any borrowers. In view of the status of the overdue loans, the loss of contact of the borrowers, and difficulty to enforce the underlying pledged assets and personal guarantees located in Mainland China, the collectability of the loans was doubtful and the management made a full impairment provision against the outstanding amount of the loan portfolio. However, the Auditor is of the views that since no valuation on the underlying pledged assets and no sufficient audit evidence obtained for credit risk assessments over the borrowers and guarantors were performed, they could not obtain sufficient audit evidence that the full impairment on the loan portfolio provided by the management reflects fairly the recoverability of the loans.The view of the Board and the Audit Committee on this audit qualificationThe Company™s management has consulted legal professional in both Mainland China and Hong Kong on the enforceability of the loan agreements and underlying pledged assets and personal guarantees. It was advised that (i) one of the borrowers has already filed bankruptcy in the PRC; (ii) validity of the personal guarantees provided by the two guarantors were uncertain; and (iii) some pledges may require sophisticated and costly legal procedures to realise. Due to the fact that most of the pledged assets are unlisted equity stakes in Mainland China companies, the management is given to understand that, even the pledges could be legally enforced, the chance to dispose of and realise the pledged assets is remote.At the same time, to avoid the expenses of and uncertainties surrounding the initiation of legal actions for enforcing the repayment, personal guarantees and pledged assets, the Board is concurrently exploring the possibility of divesting the loan receivables to distressed assets management company on such terms and conditions which are fair and reasonable to the Company.Action plan of the Group to address this audit qualificationThe Group will continue to seek legal advice from both Hong Kong and Mainland China legal advisors and try to enforce the rights under the loan agreements. At the same time, to avoid the expenses of and uncertainties surrounding the initiation of civil actions, the Board is concurrently seeking an appropriate buyer engaged in distressed debt assets management to whom the Company can dispose of loan receivables and/or the pledged assets as distressed assets on such terms and conditions which are fair and reasonable to the Company. If the Company is able to complete the aforesaid disposal or realization of the pledged asset before December 31, 2020, it is currently expected the basis of this audit qualification to the Company™s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 will not be carried forward to the year ending December 31, 2020.Notwithstanding the above, the Board will continue to make all lawful efforts to protect and uphold rights and interests of the Company where necessary, take all reasonable steps to resolve these audit matters and work with the Company™s auditor closely to see if the disclaimer of opinion has any carry-over effect to the Company™s financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2020. Should all the above issues being resolved on or before end of 2020, the Group expects that the above disclaimer of opinion would only affect the opening balances of the consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2020 and the amount and allocation of profit or loss on the impaired assets between the two financial years 2019 and 2020. For the year ending December 31, 2021, it is expected that qualifications will only be on the comparative figures of the consolidated financial statements. Should everything spell out as planned, all the qualifications will be removed in the consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2022.",True

Management considered the relevant U.S. GAAP guidance, and focused on the legal enforceability of the agreement, and determined that the contract inception date was in 2014. In the absence of specific guidance and with the diversity in practice, management assessed various views derived from the interpretations of relevant U.S. GAAP and made reference to the relevant guidance of other international accounting framework, and recognized the difference under interest and investment income, net with a corresponding increase to the initial carrying value of the investment in Ant Group.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the investment in Ant Group is a critical audit matter are that there was significant judgment and estimation by management in applying accounting principles related to the measurement of the 33% equity interest in Ant Group and recognizing the related gain, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to management™s determination of the contract inception date and the accounting treatment for the difference between the Company™s share of the fair value of Ant Group™s net assets acquired and the cost of investment when the former is greater than the latter.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the measurement of the 33% equity interest in Ant Group, including controls over management™s application of accounting principles related to the measurement of the 33% equity interest in Ant Group and the recognition of the related gain. These procedures also included, among others, testing management™s determination of the contract inception date and the accounting treatment for the difference between the Company™s share of the fair value of Ant Group™s net assets acquired and the cost of investment. Evaluating management™s determination of the contract inception date included (i) evaluating management™s assessment of when the legally enforceable right first exists and (ii) evaluating Ant Group™s obligation and commitment to pursue the regulatory approvals relevant to the transaction. Evaluating the accounting treatment for the difference between the Company™s share of the fair value of Ant Group™s net assets acquired and the cost of investment included obtaining and examining management™s evaluation of the transaction.

Annual Report 2020118Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements38 EVENTS OCCURRING AFTER THE REPORTING PERIODOn 7 April 2020, the Japan government declared the state of emergency declaration in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. Entertainment facilities including pachinko and pachislot halls were requested to be suspended from operation by the local government. As a result, the Group had suspended operation of all 53 pachinko and pachislot halls and the restaurants in Japan since April 2020. With the decreasing number of infected cases in early May 2020, the Japan government has eased its restriction measure gradually and most of the Group™s pachinko and pachislot halls had resumed operations sequentially in the same month.As a result of the temporarily lockdown of pachinko and pachislot halls in Japan, the Group anticipates that the financial results and business operations will be negatively impacted after March 2020. Although the restriction and social-distancing measures imposed have been released subsequently, the Group expects the adverse effects may continue in the future. As of the reporting date, the management is still in process of assessing the overall financial effect and is subject to further evaluation. The Group will pay close attention to the development of the COVID-19 outbreak and evaluate its impact on the financial position and operating results of the Group.IAS 10 ﬁEvents After the Reporting Periodﬂ defines an adjusting event as an event that provides evidence of conditions that existed at the reporting date.

The recoverable amount of the Group™s CGUs may be lower if the COVID-19 outbreak continues for a prolonged period.Notwithstanding the recent negative impact on the Group™s operations, management™s assessment indicates that the going concern basis continues to be appropriate for the Group for the next 12 months from the reporting date and the Group will be able to comply with all bank covenants for the year ending 31 March 2021.",True

The management of the Group considers the probability of default in negligible and accordingly, no loss allowance was recognised.Liquidity riskFor the management of the liquidity risk, the Group monitors and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents deemed adequate by management to finance the Group™s operations and mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows. The management monitors the utilisation of bank borrowings and ensures compliance with loan covenants.The following table details the Group™s remaining contractual maturity for their non-derivative financial liabilities. The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. Specifically, bank borrowings with a repayment on demand clause are included in the earliest time band regardless of the probability of the banks choosing to exercise their rights. The maturity dates for other non-derivative financial liabilities are based on the agreed repayment dates.The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (Continued)36.2 Credit risk (Continued)Impairment and provisioning policiesThe Group™s policy requires the review of individual outstanding amounts at least monthly or more regularly depending on individual circumstances or market condition.The impairment requirements under HKFRS 9 are based on an expected credit loss model. The Group applies simpli˜ed approach to measure ECLs on trade receivables from cash clients and clearing house; and general approach to measure ECLs on trade receivables from margin loans receivables, loans and interest receivables, cash and cash equivalents, trust bank balances held on behalf of client and other ˜nancial assets accounted for at amortised cost. Under the simpli˜ed approach, the Group measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs. Under the general approach, ˜nancial assets migrate through the following three stages based on the change in credit risk since initial recognition: Stage 1: 12-months ECLs, Stage 2: Lifetime ECLs Š not credit-impaired and Stage 3: Lifetime ECLs Š credit-impaired.Assessment of signi˜cant increase in credit riskWhen determining whether the risk of default has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group considers both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on the Group™s historical experience and internal credit risk assessment, including forward-looking information. The loan and advances use the number of days past due and loan-to-collateral value or loan-to-credit enhancement value to determine significant increase in credit risk. Credit risk is deemed to have increased signi˜cantly if there is a signi˜cant deterioration of the above factors at the reporting date relative to that at the date of initial recognition.Calculation of ECLsThe ECLs are assessed by the Group on regular basis. Based on the aforesaid factors, margin loan receivables and loan and interest receivables are classi˜ed into 3 stages.ECLs for margin receivables, loan and interest receivables under stage 1 is calculated on collective basis. Form margin loan receivables and loan and interest receivables under stage 2 and stage 3, the lifetime ECLs is calculated.The ECLs of non-standard ˜nancing Group has pre-de˜ned loss rate reference to the default rate for from external rating agencies.If there is material decrease in collaterals and credit enhancement values and the full recovery of the loan is in doubt, the loan will be classi˜ed into stage 3. For the loans classi˜ed as stage 3, the Group may further calculate the ECL based on probability-weighted scenarios to measure the expected credit loss. Each scenario is associated with different exposure at default and probability.",True

They are still not operating at normal capacity.In addition, the operations of certain of the Group™s customers, suppliers are also located in Wuhan or other cities in Mainland China, the outbreak of COVID-19 is expected to have negative effect to these counterparties in different aspects, which in turn, may affect the recoverability of Group™s trade receivables and other financial assets that are subject to ECL assessment.The Directors of the Company will continue to closely monitor the development of the epidemic and work to mitigate the adverse effects, and will adopt various measures to make up for the production shortfall. As the situation remains fluid at the date these financial statements are authorized for issue, the directors of the Company considered that the financial effects of the COVID-19 on the Group™s consolidated financial statements cannot be reasonably estimated. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 outbreak is expected to affect the consolidated results for the first half and full year of 2020.",True

AUDITOR™S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor™s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with China Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.As part of an audit in accordance with China Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:(1) Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.(2) Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.(3) Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.(4) Conclude on the appropriateness of the management™s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on Hisense Appliances™s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor™s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor™s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Hisense Appliances to cease to continue as a going concern.(5) Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.(6) Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within Hisense Appliances to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor™s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.",True

The outbreak and its impact on the recoverable amounts of the related assets (if any) will be considered in the impairment test to be performed in 2020.Š In determining the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets of certain entities within the Group, expected taxable profits are estimated based on the operating environment of the Group as at 31 December 2019. The outbreak and its impact on the Group™s performance may affect the carrying amounts of such deferred tax assets to be recognised and hence the net profit in 2020.Š The Group might have to experience longer turnover time for recovering its trade receivables which may increase the associated credit risks.Š Completion progress of the certain construction projects of the Group may be delayed resulting from the outbreak.As the extent to which the coronavirus outbreak will continue is uncertain, it is not practicable to estimate the full financial effect that the coronavirus outbreak may have on the Group™s businesses as at the date when the financial statements are authorised to issue.",True

Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (ﬁCOVID-19ﬂ) in January 2020, the prevention and control of the COVID-19 has been going on throughout the country. The Group will earnestly implement the requirements of the Notice on Further Strengthening the Financial Support for Prevention and Control of the COVID-19, which was jointly issued by the PBOC, the MOF, the CBIRC, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, and strengthen support for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic.At present, the Group™s operation is generally stable, while the COVID-19 epidemic has taken a phased toll on the economy, and thus likely has impacted the quality or the yields of the assets of the Group to a certain extend. The magnitude of the impact depends on the situation of the epidemic preventive measures, the duration of the epidemic and the implementation of regulatory policies. The ECL of the Group at 31 December 2019 was estimated based on a range of forecast economic conditions as at that date.The Group will continuously and closely monitor the developments of the COVID-19 epidemic as well as various regulatory policies, evaluate and proactively address its impacts on the Group™s financial position and performance of the Group. As of the date of this report, such evaluation is still in progress.VIII.

During the year ended 31 December 2019, the Group delivered the crude oil to the Entity.48. EVENTS AFTER THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIODSaved as disclosed elsewhere in these consolidated financial statements, the Group has the following events after the end of the reporting period:The development and spread of the COVID-19 and Saudi-Russian price war subsequent to the end of the reporting period have adversely impacted global economic activities and market sentiments. In respect of COVID-19, a series of precautionary and control measures have been and continued to be implemented across the PRC and worldwide. As a trader of commodities with certain storage business, these events have not directly impacted the operations of the Group. Nonetheless, the reduced demand for commodities and the resulting decline in their prices can reasonably be expected to have an impact on the Group™s future financial performance. However, the directors of the Company considered that the financial effects of the COVID-19 on the Group™s consolidated financial statements cannot be reasonably estimated at this stage as the situation remains fluid globally at the date of these consolidated financial statements are authorised for issue.

The Company has established crisis management mechanism and programs, and has formulated effective contingency measures and plans for various businesses, especially for key risks and emergencies such as liquidity crisis and accidents on transaction system, while emergency response mechanism has been established and is drilled sporadically on a regular or irregular basis.The Company is responsible for building mechanisms for communicating and reporting risk information and significant risk warnings, communicating and managing risk information and providing significant risk warnings. The Risk Management Department is responsible for formulating operational procedures for communicating and reporting risk information and issuing risk warnings, and the departments and branches and subsidiaries report risk information or issue warnings on potential risks identified by themselves to the Risk Management Department. The Risk Management Department then manages the risk information, performs comprehensive analyses on various risk information to identify risk control weaknesses and loopholes and propose recommendations on improving risk control, reports significant risks to the Chief Risk Officer and executive management or a Risk Management Committee, and at the same time, communicates risk information to relevant departments, while tracking any follow-up activities. The Risk Management Department prepares risk reports and risk control recommendation reports according to the results on risk identification, monitoring and assessment, and reports the findings to involved parties and the executive management of the Company. The Risk Management Department continuously monitors risks and the risk control status by following up on the implementation of risk control recommendations by relevant parties in managing risks identified in the risk reports.Risk analysis and controlFinancial risks in the Company™s daily operating activities primarily include market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, and operational risk. The Company has established specific policies and procedures to identify and address these risks, set out appropriate risk limits and internal control processes to manage these risks, and built integrated control system and information technology systems to continuously monitor these risks.",True

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued)b) Financial risk management objectives and policies (Continued)ii) Interest rate risk (Continued) Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to variable interest rates of bank deposits of the Group. The analysis is prepared assuming the bank balances outstanding at the end of the reporting period were outstanding for the whole year. A 100 basis point increase or decrease is used, which represents management™s assessment of reasonably possible changes in interest rates. If interest rates had been 100 basis point higher and all other variables were held constant, the Group™s profit for the year ended 31 December 2019 and the retained earnings as at the reporting date would increase by approximately RMB386,000 (2018: RMB451,000). An equal and opposite impact on the Group™s profit for the respective years would result if the interest rates had been 100 basis points lower.iii) Credit risk The management considers the credit risk exposure of the Group™s trade receivables is low as sales are generally settled before delivery of goods or within 30 days. The directors review the recoverable amount of each individual debt regularly to ensure that adequate allowances are recognised for irrecoverable amounts. In this regard, the directors consider that the Group™s credit risk is significantly reduced. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk in respect of its trade and other receivables, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers. The credit risk in liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings.iv) Liquidity risk The Group™s liquidity position is monitored closely by the directors. In managing liquidity risk, the Group monitors and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents adequate for the management to finance the Group™s operations and mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows. The Group mainly relies on internally generated funds and banking facilities as the principal sources of liquidity. The following table details the Group™s remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities. For non-derivative financial liabilities, the table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.",True

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont™d)  2.5 Property, plant and equipment (cont™d)  (f) Disposal  An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset is included in profit or loss in the year the asset is derecognised.  2.6 Assets held for sale  Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amounts and fair value less costs to sell. Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and the sale is highly probable. Assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated.  2.7 Lease transaction closing costs  Upfront legal fees and all other initial direct costs incurred in procuring the lease for the aircraft are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the related lease period in profit or loss.  Where the lease agreement is terminated or novated prior to its expiry date, the remaining lease transaction closing costs will be written off to profit or loss.  2.8 Impairment of non-financial assets  The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when an annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset™s recoverable amount.  An asset™s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset™s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account, if available. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.  For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset™s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset™s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increase cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised previously. Such reversal is recognised in profit or loss.   ",True

The bank deposits and borrowings bear interest at variable rates and expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and fair value interest rate risk respectively.  The Group™s interest rate profile is monitored by management.        Sensitivity analysis             At 31 December 2019, it is estimated that a general increase/decrease of 100 basis points in the interest rates, with all other variables held constant, it would have increased/decreased the Group™s profit after tax and accumulated losses by approximately RMB70,000 (2018: decreased/increased the Group™s profit after tax and increased/decreased of accumulated losses by approximately RMB65,000).        (b)             The sensitivity analysis above has been determined assuming that changes in interest rates occurred at the end of the reporting period and had been applied to the exposure to interest rate risk for financial instruments in existence at that date. The 100 basis point increase or decrease represents management™s assessment of a reasonably possible change in interest rates over the period until the next annual end of reporting period. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2018.           (d) Categories of financial instruments(e) Currency risk             The Group is not exposed to significant foreign currency risk as most of income and expenses are denominated in the functional currency of the Group.       (f) Fair values             All financial instruments approximate their respective fair values as at 31 December 2019 and 2018.                           2019RMB™0002018RMB™0002017RMB™0002016RMB™0002015RMB™000",True
