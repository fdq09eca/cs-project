(In Provisional Liquidation) (the ﬁCompanyﬂ) and its subsidiaries (together the ﬁGroupﬂ) set out on pages 26 to 72, which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2019, and the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.We do not express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements of the Group and whether the consolidated financial statements have been properly prepared in compliance with the disclosure requirements of Hong Kong Companies Ordinance. Because of the significance of the matters described in the Basis for Disclaimer of Opinion section of our report, we have not been able to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for an audit opinion on these consolidated financial statements.BASIS FOR DISCLAIMER OF OPINIONScope limitation due to incomplete books and recordsUp to the date of this report, given the incomplete books and records and serious doubts over the reliability of the Group™s accounting and other records, the provisional liquidators acting as agents of the Company (without liability and recourse) (the ﬁProvisional Liquidatorsﬂ) believe that it is almost impossible, and not practical, to ascertain the correct revenue and profit or loss (and the resultant assets and liabilities) for the current year for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements of the Group. Also, due to incomplete books and records, the Provisional Liquidators of the Company believe that it is almost impossible, and not practical, to verify the financial information as reported in the consolidated financial statements of the Group and financial statements of the Company for the past years and, in particular prior to the appointment of the Provisional Liquidators on 25 February 2015. We were therefore unable to carry out satisfactory audit procedures to obtain reasonable assurance regarding the completeness, accuracy, existence, valuation, classification and disclosures of the transactions contingent liabilities and commitments of the Group and the Company for the years ended 31 December 2018 and 2019.Given these circumstances, which are more fully disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements, there were no practicable audit procedures that we could perform to satisfy ourselves that the information and documents presented to us for the purpose of our audit are complete and accurate in all material respects, nor to quantify the extent of adjustments that might be necessary in respect of the Group™s and the Company™s financial information.As a result, in performing our audit on the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2019, there were no practicable audit procedures that we could perform to satisfy ourselves whether the balances of assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, commitments and reserves as at 1 January 2018, 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2019 were fairly stated.Included in the note to the Company-level statement of financial position are interests in subsidiaries of RMB278,164,000 and RMB278,164,000 and loans to subsidiaries of RMB2,421,000 and RMB2,421,000 as at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2019 respectively. Due to the scope limitations as mentioned above, we are unable to satisfy ourselves as to the fairness of the amounts carried as interests in subsidiaries and loans to subsidiaries in the Company-level statement of financial position or to determine whether any provision for impairment loss is necessary in respect of the above. Any adjustments would have a consequential effect on the net liabilities of the Company as at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2019 and of its net loss for the years then ended and the related disclosures in the Company-level statement of financial position and reserves."

This included communication from the Group to component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identi˜ed at Group level. The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the ˜nancial statements varies considerably. Firstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly  affect the ˜nancial statements including ˜nancial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable pro˜ts legislation and taxation legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related ˜nancial statement items. Secondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the ˜nancial statements, for instance through the imposition of ˜nes or litigation or the loss of the Group™s licence to operate. We identi˜ed the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: regulatory capital and liquidity, conduct, ˜nancial crime including money laundering, sanctions list and market abuse regulations recognising the ˜nancial and regulated nature of the Group™s activities. Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the Directors and other management  and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Through these procedures, we became aware of actual or suspected non-compliance and considered the effect as part of our procedures on the related ˜nancial statement items. The identi˜ed actual or suspected non-compliance was not suf˜ciently signi˜cant to our  audit to result in our response being identi˜ed as a key audit matter.Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements  in the ˜nancial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards.  For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations (irregularities) is from the events and transactions  re˚ected in the ˜nancial statements, the less likely the inherently  limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it.  In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of irregularities, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance  and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws  and regulations. 8 The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities This report is made solely to the Company™s members, as a body,  in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.
